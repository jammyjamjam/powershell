WinRM                                     Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a      
                                          standard web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on the network for  
                                          WS-Management requests and processes them. The WinRM Service needs to be configured with a listener using winrm.cmd command    
                                          line tool or through Group Policy in order for it to listen over the network. The WinRM service provides access to WMI data    
                                          and enables event collection. Event collection and subscription to events require that the service is running. WinRM messages  
                                          use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a port with IIS on    
                                          the same machine.  The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent conflicts with IIS, administrators should      
                                          ensure that any websites hosted on IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.

BFE                 The Base Filtering Engine (BFE) is a service that manages firewall and Internet Protocol security (IPsec) policies and implements user mode          
                    filtering. Stopping or disabling the BFE service will significantly reduce the security of the system. It will also result in unpredictable behavior 
                    in IPsec management and firewall applications.                                                                                                       
COMSysApp           Manages the configuration and tracking of Component Object Model (COM)+-based components. If the service is stopped, most COM+-based components will 
                    not function properly. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.

DiagTrack           The Connected User Experiences and Telemetry service enables features that support in-application and connected user experiences. Additionally, this 
                    service manages the event driven collection and transmission of diagnostic and usage information (used to improve the experience and quality of the  
                    Windows Platform) when the diagnostics and usage privacy option settings are enabled under Feedback and Diagnostics.                                 
dmwappushservice    Routes Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Push messages received by the device and synchronizes Device Management sessions                          
Dnscache            The DNS Client service (dnscache) caches Domain Name System (DNS) names and registers the full computer name for this computer. If the service is    
                    stopped, DNS names will continue to be resolved. However, the results of DNS name queries will not be cached and the computer's name will not be     
                    registered. If the service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                                                
dot3svc             The Wired AutoConfig (DOT3SVC) service is responsible for performing IEEE 802.1X authentication on Ethernet interfaces. If your current wired        
                    network deployment enforces 802.1X authentication, the DOT3SVC service should be configured to run for establishing Layer 2 connectivity and/or      
                    providing access to network resources. Wired networks that do not enforce 802.1X authentication are unaffected by the DOT3SVC service.               
Eaphost             The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) service provides network authentication in such scenarios as 802.1x wired and wireless, VPN, and        
                    Network Access Protection (NAP).  EAP also provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that are used by network access clients, including     
                    wireless and VPN clients, during the authentication process.  If you disable this service, this computer is prevented from accessing networks that   
                    require EAP authentication.                                                                                                                          
EventSystem         Supports System Event Notification Service (SENS), which provides automatic distribution of events to subscribing Component Object Model (COM)       
                    components. If the service is stopped, SENS will close and will not be able to provide logon and logoff notifications. If this service is disabled,  
                    any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                                                                                        
fdPHost             The FDPHOST service hosts the Function Discovery (FD) network discovery providers. These FD providers supply network discovery services for the      
                    Simple Services Discovery Protocol (SSDP) and Web Services – Discovery (WS-D) protocol. Stopping or disabling the FDPHOST service will disable       
                    network discovery for these protocols when using FD. When this service is unavailable, network services using FD and relying on these discovery      
                    protocols will be unable to find network devices or resources.                                                                                       
IKEEXT              The IKEEXT service hosts the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Authenticated Internet Protocol (AuthIP) keying modules. These keying modules are used  
                    for authentication and key exchange in Internet Protocol security (IPsec). Stopping or disabling the IKEEXT service will disable IKE and AuthIP key  
                    exchange with peer computers. IPsec is typically configured to use IKE or AuthIP; therefore, stopping or disabling the IKEEXT service might result   
                    in an IPsec failure and might compromise the security of the system. It is strongly recommended that you have the IKEEXT service running.            
iphlpsvc            Provides tunnel connectivity using IPv6 transition technologies (6to4, ISATAP, Port Proxy, and Teredo), and IP-HTTPS. If this service is stopped,    
                    the computer will not have the enhanced connectivity benefits that these technologies offer.                                                         
KtmRm               Coordinates transactions between the Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) and the Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM). If it is not needed, it   
                    is recommended that this service remain stopped. If it is needed, both MSDTC and KTM will start this service automatically. If this service is       
                    disabled, any MSDTC transaction interacting with a Kernel Resource Manager will fail and any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to      
                    start.                                                                                                                                               
lfsvc               This service monitors the current location of the system and manages geofences (a geographical location with associated events).  If you turn off    
                    this service, applications will be unable to use or receive notifications for geolocation or geofences.                                              
lltdsvc             Creates a Network Map, consisting of PC and device topology (connectivity) information, and metadata describing each PC and device.  If this service 
                    is disabled, the Network Map will not function properly.                                                                                             
lmhosts             Provides support for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) service and NetBIOS name resolution for clients on the network, therefore enabling users to     
                    share files, print, and log on to the network. If this service is stopped, these functions might be unavailable. If this service is disabled, any    
                    services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                                                                                            
MSiSCSI             Manages Internet SCSI (iSCSI) sessions from this computer to remote iSCSI target devices. If this service is stopped, this computer will not be able 
                    to login or access iSCSI targets. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                         
msiserver           Adds, modifies, and removes applications provided as a Windows Installer (*.msi, *.msp) package. If this service is disabled, any services that      
                    explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                                                                                                          
nsi                 This service delivers network notifications (e.g. interface addition/deleting etc) to user mode clients. Stopping this service will cause loss of    
                    network connectivity. If this service is disabled, any other services that explicitly depend on this service will fail to start.                     
p2pimsvc            Provides identity services for the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) and Peer-to-Peer Grouping services.  If disabled, the Peer Name Resolution   
                    Protocol (PNRP) and Peer-to-Peer Grouping services may not function, and some applications, such as HomeGroup and Remote Assistance, may not         
                    function correctly.                                                                                                                                  
PcaSvc              This service provides support for the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA).  PCA monitors programs installed and run by the user and detects known  
                    compatibility problems. If this service is stopped, PCA will not function properly.                                                                  
PNRPsvc             Enables serverless peer name resolution over the Internet using the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP). If disabled, some peer-to-peer and         
                    collaborative applications, such as Remote Assistance, may not function.

RasMan              Manages dial-up and virtual private network (VPN) connections from this computer to the Internet or other remote networks. If this service is        
                    disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                                                                              
RpcEptMapper        Resolves RPC interfaces identifiers to transport endpoints. If this service is stopped or disabled, programs using Remote Procedure Call (RPC)       
                    services will not function properly.                                                                                                                 
RpcLocator          In Windows 2003 and earlier versions of Windows, the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator service manages the RPC name service database. In Windows   
                    Vista and later versions of Windows, this service does not provide any functionality and is present for application compatibility.                   
SamSs               The startup of this service signals other services that the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) is ready to accept requests.  Disabling this service     
                    will prevent other services in the system from being notified when the SAM is ready, which may in turn cause those services to fail to start         
                    correctly. This service should not be disabled.

SNMPTRAP            Receives trap messages generated by local or remote Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agents and forwards the messages to SNMP management    
                    programs running on this computer. If this service is stopped, SNMP-based programs on this computer will not receive SNMP trap messages. If this     
                    service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.                                                                   
SstpSvc             Provides support for the Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) to connect to remote computers using VPN. If this service is disabled, users will   
                    not be able to use SSTP to access remote servers.                                                                                                    
TapiSrv             Provides Telephony API (TAPI) support for programs that control telephony devices on the local computer and, through the LAN, on servers that are    
                    also running the service.                                                                                                                            
wcncsvc             WCNCSVC hosts the Windows Connect Now Configuration which is Microsoft's Implementation of Wireless Protected Setup (WPS) protocol. This is used to  
                    configure Wireless LAN settings for an Access Point (AP) or a Wireless Device. The service is started programmatically as needed.                    
WinHttpAutoProxySvc WinHTTP implements the client HTTP stack and provides developers with a Win32 API and COM Automation component for sending HTTP requests and         
                    receiving responses. In addition, WinHTTP provides support for auto-discovering a proxy configuration via its implementation of the Web Proxy        
                    Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol.                                                                                                                      
WinRM               Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard web services      
                    protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes them.   
                    The WinRM Service needs to be configured with a listener using winrm.cmd command line tool or through Group Policy in order for it to listen over    
                    the network. The WinRM service provides access to WMI data and enables event collection. Event collection and subscription to events require that    
                    the service is running. WinRM messages use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a    
                    port with IIS on the same machine.  The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent conflicts with IIS, administrators should ensure    
                    that any websites hosted on IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.                                                                                    
WlanSvc             The WLANSVC service provides the logic required to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless local area network (WLAN) as      
                    defined by IEEE 802.11 standards. It also contains the logic to turn your computer into a software access point so that other devices or computers   
                    can connect to your computer wirelessly using a WLAN adapter that can support this. Stopping or disabling the WLANSVC service will make all WLAN     
                    adapters on your computer inaccessible from the Windows networking UI. It is strongly recommended that you have the WLANSVC service running if your  
                    computer has a WLAN adapter.                                                                                                                         
wmiApSrv            Provides performance library information from Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers to clients on the network. This service only runs   
                    when Performance Data Helper is activated.                                                                                                           
wscsvc              The WSCSVC (Windows Security Center) service monitors and reports security health settings on the computer.  The health settings include firewall    
                    (on/off), antivirus (on/off/out of date), antispyware (on/off/out of date), Windows Update (automatically/manually download and install updates),    
                    User Account Control (on/off), and Internet settings (recommended/not recommended). The service provides COM APIs for independent software vendors   
                    to register and record the state of their products to the Security Center service.  The Security and Maintenance UI uses the service to provide      
                    systray alerts and a graphical view of the security health states in the Security and Maintenance control panel.  Network Access Protection (NAP)    
                    uses the service to report the security health states of clients to the NAP Network Policy Server to make network quarantine decisions.  The service 
                    also has a public API that allows external consumers to programmatically retrieve the aggregated security health state of the system.                
wuauserv            Enables the detection, download, and installation of updates for Windows and other programs. If this service is disabled, users of this computer     
                    will not be able to use Windows Update or its automatic updating feature, and programs will not be able to use the Windows Update Agent (WUA) API.   
WwanSvc             This service manages mobile broadband (GSM & CDMA) data card/embedded module adapters and connections by auto-configuring the networks. It is        
                    strongly recommended that this service be kept running for best user experience of mobile broadband devices.
